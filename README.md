# Snakemake Ensemble Assembly Pipeline

This repository contains a bioinformatics pipeline for ensemble genome assembly using Snakemake. The pipeline integrates *de novo* and reference-based assembly approaches to improve assembly quality for similar (e.g., bacterial) genomes while removing contaminant sequences (e.g., from host DNA).

## Installation

1. **Create Conda environment**:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f workflow/env/myenv.yaml
   conda activate myenv
   ```

2. **Install Snakemake** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge snakemake
   ```

## Running the Pipeline

To run the pipeline:

```bash
snakemake --use-conda
```

## Configuration

Edit `config/config.yaml` to customize parameters such as input FASTQ files, reference genome path, and tool settings for the assembly steps.

## Workflow Overview

- Initial *de novo* assembly of input reads  
- Selection of best assembly to serve as reference  
- Reference-based improvement of other assemblies  
- Consensus genome construction  
- Filtering of contaminant sequences  

## Results

Output files will be saved in the `results/` directory and include assembled genomes, intermediate files, quality reports, and the final consensus assembly.

## Acknowledgments

This pipeline incorporates tools for *de novo* and reference-based genome assembly. Tool choices may include (but are not limited to): **SPAdes**, **BWA**, **Samtools**, and **QUAST**.
